# OpenCV [Open Computer Vision]
Learning OpenCV from Scratch — Code examples for image &amp; video processing

**About This Repository — OpenCV & Computer Vision Journey**

This repository is dedicated to learning and mastering Computer Vision using OpenCV, one of the most powerful and widely used libraries in the AI ecosystem. Here, I explore various fundamental and practical concepts — from image processing to real-time video analysis — through hands-on code examples and small projects. You can learn OpenCV by following this repo consistantly. All chaptersb are devided into fregments, so that everyone can underdtand the topic properly.

**_Why Computer Vision Matters_**

Computer Vision enables machines to see, understand, and interpret visual information like humans. **It plays a key role in:**

-> Face recognition & object detection

-> Self-driving cars & traffic monitoring

 -> Medical image analysis

 -> AR filters & gesture recognition

 -> Robotics and automation

Wherever vision-based intelligence is needed — Computer Vision is there.

**_Why OpenCV?_**

OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a fast, powerful, and industry-standard toolkit for image & video processing. **It is widely used because:**

-> Supports real-time processing

-> Contains 2500+ optimized algorithms

-> Works across Python, C++, Java, etc.

-> Perfect for AI, ML, and Deep Learning integration

-> Open-source & highly scalable

This makes OpenCV a must-learn skill for anyone entering the AI field.

**_Why I’m Learning OpenCV_**

As an aspiring AI / Machine Learning Engineer, **I want to build strong fundamentals in:**

1. How computers view images (pixels, channels, histograms)

2. Preprocessing data for ML & DL models

3. Feature extraction for intelligent applications

4. Building projects that involve real-world camera feeds & vision tasks

Mastering OpenCV helps me step into professional AI development — from simple visual tasks to advanced neural network integration.

**_This repo will continuously grow with:_**

=> Image processing fundamentals
=> Feature detection techniques
=> Real-time camera projects
=> Mini Computer Vision applications
